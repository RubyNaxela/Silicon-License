        <h1>Silicon License</h1>

        <h2>Version 1, 16 June 2022<br>Copyright (c) 2022 Alex Pawelski</h2>

        <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
            this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

        <h3>0. Definitions</h3>

        <p>This "License" refers to version 1 of the Silicon License.</p>

        <p>"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
            other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>

        <p>An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface
            provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
            Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library
            is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>

        <p>A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
            Application with the Library. The particular version of the
            Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the
            "Linked Version".</p>

        <h3>1. Conveying Modified Versions</h3>

        <p>Modified versions of The Library may be distributed under the
            same License, provided that they are plainly marked as such,
            mentioning the original name and author of The Library.</p>

        <h3>2. Combined Works</h3>

        <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice, if
            you also do both of the following:</p>

        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work
                that The Library is used in it and that The Library and its
                use are covered by this License.
            </li>
            <li>
                For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
                execution, include the copyright notice for the Library
                among these notices.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3. Combined Libraries</h3>

        <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
            Library side by side in a single library together with other
            library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered
            by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms
            of your choice, if you also do the following:</p>

        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of
                it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
                find the uncombined form of the same work.
            </li>
        </ol>
